 * bucket.c -- bucket implementation

 * between the heap-managed chunks/runs and memory allocations.
 *
 * Each bucket instance can have a different underlying container that is
 * responsible for selecting blocks - which means that whether the allocator
 * serves memory blocks in best/first/next -fit manner is decided during bucket
 * creation.
